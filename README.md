# My Project

Welcome to my project! Here's a brief overview of what I've accomplished so far:

## Project Overview

I have created a certificate and built a front-end template using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. This front-end template serves as the user interface for my application.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript

## AWS Services

I've leveraged several AWS services to enhance the functionality and scalability of my project:

1. **CloudFront**: I'm using AWS CloudFront for content delivery, which helps to improve the performance of my web application by distributing it to edge locations worldwide.

2. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: SNS is being used for messaging within the application. It enables me to send notifications and messages to users or other parts of my system.

3. **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway serves as the entry point for my application, enabling me to create, publish, and manage RESTful APIs.

4. **Route 53**: AWS Route 53 is responsible for domain name system (DNS) and routing requests to the appropriate AWS resources.

## Current Status

So far, the project is progressing well, and I'm excited about the features and technologies I've integrated. I'll continue to update this README as the project evolves.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions!
